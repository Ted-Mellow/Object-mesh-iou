# Object-mesh-iou
Python script for 45 degrees angle rotation IOU comparison for object and respective mesh.

AIM: a script that given 1. an image of a single object with removed background and 2. the mesh of that object:
Calculate the intersection over union of the image and the object
Proceed to apply 45 degree rotations to the object and return the angle at which you have the maximum intersection over union.
